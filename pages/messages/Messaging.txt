**Messaging Directory:**
   - Within the Pages directory, create a dedicated directory for messaging-related files.
   - This directory can include subdirectories for different aspects of messaging, such as:
     - Conversations
     - Contacts
     - Settings
     - Components (for reusable components like message cards or chat interfaces)
